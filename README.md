# Distributed Computing

In this project, I implement parallel algorithms leveraging different parallel computing libraries, which have a very wide variety of important applications, such as machine learning, data science, and scientific computing.

The parallelization of those algorithms, helped by the ubiquity of multicore/massively parallel processors, the infrastructure of distributed computing, and optimally efficient task scheduling, has made them feasible for those applications at a large scale, advancing humanity's innovation.

So far, I use Python's [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) library, which is super efficient. I previously used Dask for [image processing](https://github.com/WilliamZhang20/Object-Detection) to process multiple images at once.

I hope to also implement it from scratch in C++, and redo it again leveraging Go's multiprocessing paradigms.
